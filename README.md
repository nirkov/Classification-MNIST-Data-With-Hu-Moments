From my tests it seems difficult to characterize a certain pattern of accuracy results depending
on 𝜸 or c where each time one of them is a constant (In general, it is difficult to extract information
by looking at csv files) and the other is variable. To get a slightly clearer picture, I attach graphs
of the accuracy function, as a function of 𝜸 and c, such that –
